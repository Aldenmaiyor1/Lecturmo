# 1. Features Overview

### User Identity Management Suite
- **Verification Processes:** 
Users initiate the verification process by providing their university email address. Subsequently, Lecturmo sends a verification email to the provided university email. Upon receiving the email, users are required to click on the verification link enclosed within the email to complete the verification process, thereby ensuring the authenticity and reliable of their identity.

- **User Login & Registration:** 
Providing secure login and registration processes for users to access and interact with the website.

- **User Profile Management:** 
Allow users to view and update their profile information for a personalized experience.

### Attendance Management Suite
- **QR Code Attendance Tracking:**
Lecturers initiate the QR code generation process within Lecturmo and present the generated QR code to students. Students then scan the QR code using their mobile devices as part of their attendance process. To enhance security, each QR code changes every second and expires after 30 seconds, ensuring real-time and secure attendance tracking.

- **Attendance Badges:**
Students are rewarded with badges based on their attendance record, ranging from none to bronze, silver, and gold. The badge hierarchy is determined by the number of classes attended, with students achieving a bronze badge after attending three lectures, a silver badge after eight classes, and a gold badge after attending 15 classes. This system incentivizes regular attendance and recognizes students for their commitment to their academic pursuits.
